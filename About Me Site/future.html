    <h2> Where I Want to Live </h2>
    
    <p> After leaving Full Sail, I hope to, at some point, live in Seattle, Washington. I have alwasy been drawn to that place for some reason and I have been told that it's beautiful out there. I haven't done much research on what sort of web design jobs are available out there, but if nothing else, I can try to become a freelancer. I know that right out of school that is unlikely, so for the first part of my career after graduation, I will go where ever the job offered to me is. </p>
    
    <h2> What I want to be doing </h2>
    
    <p> Hopefully, my first real job as a web designer will be to work on the user interface of a site or a local company. I know people always tell me to aim big, but I try to think logically and in increments first. I make more short term goals than long term goals. I would eventually like to get experience working for a big name company, and I want to get recognized by the web design community. I want people to know my name. I want to show up in the top 20 web designers list. One day, I think it would be nice ot be a freelancer, so that I can travel. </p>
    
    <h2> How I hope to be feeling </h2>
    
    <p> I hope that I am able to get to a place of content. I want to make a life for myself where I can be comfortable and at peace. </p>
