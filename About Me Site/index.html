    <p id="blog"> Today is going to be crazy. I am going to Disney with my friend Claire for the first time since she has gotten her pass, and I am super excited. I forgot how much I actually enjoy Disney, especially on the days where it's cold and not super crowded. </p>

    
    <h4>Sunday Janurary 24, 2016</h4>
    <p id="blog"> I finally get to have a realxing day! Since coming to Full Sail, I have been busy all the time. I like it when I can have days where I sit and do nothing but relax and just enjoy my own company. </p>
