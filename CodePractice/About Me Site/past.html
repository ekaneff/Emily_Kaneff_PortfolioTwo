    <h2> Expeirences and Highlights </h2>
            
    <h4> Chours </h4>
    <p> In my first two years of school, I was a part of the chorus program. I have always had a love for music and singing, so I fit right in when I joined chorus. One major noteworthy experience was when I got to sing in the candlelight processional at Disney's Epcot. I will never forget the feeling of standing up there with dozens of other people from all over wearing gold robes and just singing together in perfect untiy. It was something that the majority of people will never get to experience, so I am more than grateful I was able to be part of it. </p>
    
    <h4> Senior Year of High School </h4>
    <p> It was in my senior year of high school that I realized who I wanted to be and how I wanted other people to see me. I went out and did things I never saw myself doing before. Some of the highlights are as follows: 
            <ul>
            <li> Joining a robotics team that went on to compete in the national competition in Saint Louis </li>
            <li> Learning sign language and becoming an active part of the sign language club at my school as well as attending a silent dinner </li>
            <li> Meeting a group of friends that I felt really comfortable with and there was no drama</li>
            <li> Taking a class called Virtual Enterprise that allowed me to see how a real business operates and I was able to attend business plan compeitions </li></li>
            </ul>
        I became super invloved in my community through being inducted into the National Honor Society whic presented me with severl networking opportunities early on. I will alwasy remember by senior year as the one that really helped shape me into the person I am today.
